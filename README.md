## Installation ##

Make sure you do have a recent Arduino IDE. Then follow these instructions (Board Manager works fine with nodemcu):

https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino

Open up the pj.ino file in the Arduino IDE, select your ESP8266 board, compile and flash. Make sure to change the ssid, pwd and server setup to your setup.

Make sure to have a HARDAC instance running as well.
